This app is for buildings surveying, the worker will be able to choose the building he is going to survey on the map 
and then a form will be opened with the coordinates of this point and he will be able to fill the rest of the info 
for the building and when he submits this info in the database, the app will switch again to the map with live tracking 
to the next nearest point............. the managaer will be able to track the status of all the buildings.
